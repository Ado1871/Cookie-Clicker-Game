# Cookie-Clicker-Game
A Simple Cookie Clicker Game developed as a personal project a few months ago.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cookie Clicker Game! This is a simple yet fun game where your goal is to collect as many cookies as possible. You can collect cookies by writing click, upgrading your click power, or by purchasing and upgrading auto-clickers that generate cookies for you every second.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
- Compile and run `main.cpp` using your favorite C++ compiler.
- The game starts immediately, and your cookie count is displayed along with your current cookies per click and cookies per second rates.

### Commands
- **click**: Use this command to manually click for cookies. Each click will increase your cookies based on your current cookies per click rate.
- **upgrade click**: Use this command to upgrade your click power. Upgrading costs 10 cookies, but it will increase the number of cookies you get per click.
- **upgrade auto**: Use this command to purchase or upgrade your auto-clickers. Each upgrade costs 50 cookies, but it will increase the number of cookies you get automatically every second.

### Game Loop
- The game runs in a continuous loop, simulating the passage of time, adding cookies from auto-clickers to your total, and displaying your current status.
- You can input commands to interact with the game and grow your cookie empire!

## Features
- **Manual Clicking**: Write click to earn cookies.
- **Click Power Upgrades**: Spend cookies to upgrade your clicking power.
- **Auto-clickers**: Invest in auto-clickers to earn cookies even when you're not clicking.
- **Status Display**: Keep track of your cookies, click power, and auto-clicker productivity.

## Features i wanted to add
- **Better UI for UX**
- **Different Upgrades**

## Requirements

- **Compiler**: The game was developed and tested with the GCC C++ compiler version 4.9.2. It should be compatible with most C++11 compliant compilers.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Run the compiled executable to start the game.
2. **Play the game using the commands:** click, upgrade click and upgrade auto.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the game:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
